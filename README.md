# Portfolio Template

This is the template I created for [my portfolio website](https://sachelpurvis.me). Feel free to make a copy and stylize the template to make it your own!

Note: To edit Sass files and compile it to CSS file automatically, you will need to install NodeJS/NPM to your portfolio website. All you need is to run *npm run compile:sass* in your Command Prompt or Terminal. It will compile it to style.css every save you saved a Sass file.

Technlogies used: HTML5, CSS3, Sass, PHP, Responsive Design (iPhone X and screens larger than desktop laptop are supported)
